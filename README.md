# OAS-strain-replacement
Code for reproducing results and figures in "A speed limit on serial strain replacement from original antigenic sin"

The notebook 'ro-bounds.nb' carries out the analytical derivation of the main result, the bound on $\log R_0$, and carries out numerical checks of the analytics. 

Each notebook in the folder figures/ is used to create a single figure. The calculations of the bounds on velocity, standard deviation, and $t_{\text{mrca}}$ implied by OAS, all of which are numerical, are found in the figure8.nb notebook.

All notebooks were created in Mathematica 13.1.0.0 for Mac.
