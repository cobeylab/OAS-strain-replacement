# OAS-strain-replacement
Mathematica notebooks for reproducing figures in "A speed limit on serial strain replacement from original antigenic sin."

Each notebook in the folder figures/  reproduces one figure. The calculations of the bounds on velocity, standard deviation, and $t_{\text{mrca}}$ implied by OAS are found in the figure 7 notebook.

All notebooks were created in Mathematica 13.1.0.0 for Mac.
